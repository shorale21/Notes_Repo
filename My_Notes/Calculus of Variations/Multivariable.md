We usually encounter equations with multiple dependent variables and one independent variable.
Consider function $y(u)$ and $x(u)$, we get a [[Introduction to Variational Calculus#^2a28a5|functional]]
$$\mathcal{S}=\int_{u_1}^{u_2}f[x(u),y(u),x'(u),y'(u),u]du$$
We find that each variable independently gets an [[Euler-Lagrange Equations#^ce4f09|euler-lagrange]] equation which can be solved independently.

>We often think of the $n$ generalized coordinates as defining a point in $n$-dimensional configuration space, each of whose points labels a uniqe position/configuration of the system.
