>[!example] Definition: Linear Functional
>A *linear functional* on $V$ is a [[Linear Maps#^844f9b|linear map]] from $V$ to $\mathbb{F}$.

>[!example] Riesz Representation Theorem
>Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $\varphi$ is a linear functional on $V$. Then there is a unique vector $u\in V$ such that
>$$\varphi(v)=\langle v,u\rangle$$
>for every $v\in V$
