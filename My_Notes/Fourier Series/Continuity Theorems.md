>[!example] Continuous Fourier Series
>For a [[Intro To the Fourier Series#^24448d|piecewise smooth]] function $f(x)$, the [[Intro To the Fourier Series#^0cc02e|fourier series]] of $f(x)$ is continuous for $-L\le x\le L$ if and only if $f(x)$ is continuous and $f(-L)=f(L)$

>[!example] Continuous Cosine Series
>For a [[Intro To the Fourier Series#^24448d|piecewise smooth]] $f(x)$ the [[Odd and Even Fourier Series#^153b55|fourier cosine series]] is continuous if and only if $f(x)$ is continuous

>[!example] Continuous Sine Series
>For a [[Intro To the Fourier Series#^24448d|piecewise smooth]] $f(x)$ the [[Odd and Even Fourier Series#^153b55|fourier sine series]] is continuous if and only if $f(x)$ is continuous and $f(0)=f(L)=0$
