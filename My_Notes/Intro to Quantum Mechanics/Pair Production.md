# Pair Production
The [[The Photoelectric Effect#^c3df69|photoelectric effect]] and the [[The Compton Effect#^3aeda8|compton effect]] are two ways that electromagnetic waves act as particles in certain interactions. **Production** is a third.

**Pair Production** is the process where a high energy photon creates (or becomes) two particles, a negatively charged electron, and a positively charged positron. 

**Pair Annihiliation** is the process where a positron finds an electron and they create two photons

This was discovered through the use of a **Bubble Chamber**, an experimental device where a magnetic field causes charged particles to leave bubble trails along a surface.
- It was observed that there were two oppositely curved, and almost equal trails, corresponding to oppositely charged particles. 
- Since one of the particles was an electron, the other particle had to be some sort of positively charged electron, now called the positron.
