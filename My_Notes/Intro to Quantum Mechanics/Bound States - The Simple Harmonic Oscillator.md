# Bound States - Simple Harmonic Oscillator

This is where the function $U(x)$ is a continuous finite function. We have $U(x)=\frac{1}{2}\kappa x^2$.
Inserting this into the [[Bound States - The Shrodinger Equation#^f83325|time independent shrodinger equation]] gives$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2}+\frac{1}{2}\kappa x^2\psi(x)=E\psi(x)$$

>[!example] Energy of the Harmonic Oscillator
>The rigorous solution of the above equation show the quantized energy energy can be given by$$E=(n+\frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega_0\space,\quad\text{ where }\space\omega_o=\sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{m}}$$where $n$ is an integer
