The problem with classical mechanics was that the wavelengths of the x-rays could not be arbitarily small. 

The solution was that the radiation was **quantized**, and therefore the wavelengths would only be produced from discrete values

It was also proven that electrons do not combine energies, multiple electrons cannot contribute to the release of one photon
