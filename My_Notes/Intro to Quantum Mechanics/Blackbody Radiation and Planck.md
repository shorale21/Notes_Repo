# Blackbody Radiation and Planck's constant
>[!example] Blackbody Radiation
>- A **black body** is any object where all electromagnetic radiation is absorbed
>- All radiation emitting from it is solely from the motion of contained charges

**Spectral Energy Density**
- When measuring spectral energy density, Planck found that the energy at a frequency $f$ is restricted to $E=nhf$ where $n$ is an integer and $h$ is a constant
- He found a new equation for spectral energy density:$$\frac{dU}{df}=\frac{hf}{e^{hf/k_BT}-1}\times\frac{8\pi V}{c^3}f^2$$


>[!important] Planck's Constant
>The value of $h$, **Planck's constant** is:$$6.63\times10^{-34}\space J\cdot s$$
>$$4.136\times10^{-15}\space eV\cdot s$$
>The value of $\hbar$ is:$$1.054571817\times10^{-34}\space J\cdot s$$
>$$6.582119569\times10^{-16}\space eV\cdot s$$
