# Wave or Particle?

**Experimental**
- Let the length of the experimental apparatus be $D$
- Everything can be described with a wavefunction and therefore has a wavelength, $\lambda$
- If the wavlength is comparable to the length, $\lambda\ge D$, then it will be observed experimentally to exhibit **wave** like behaviour
- If the wavelength is much shorter than the length, $\lambda\ll D$, then it will be observed to exhibit **particle** like behaviour
- A nice example of this is light. 
	- If you point a laser at a screen, you will observe a dot, like a particle
	- But if you place a slit or diffraction grating in front of the laser, an interference pattern will appear, showing wave behaviour
	- Or, if the intensity is turned way down, the points on the screen will be sporadic, as if showing the individual particles
