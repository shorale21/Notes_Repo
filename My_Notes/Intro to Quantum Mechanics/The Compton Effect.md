# The Compton Effect
This is important in **quantization**

When conducting experiments with [[X-rays#^facc08|x-rays]], Compton found that the electromagnetic radiation was not behaving in a oscillatory way, as would be predicted by classical electromagnetism.

His argument was that momentum may be quantized as well.
1. According to [[Momentum And Energy in Relativity#^f7bd73|special relativity]], an object of zero mass must have momentum related to energy given by $$E=pc$$
2. According to classical electromagnetism, waves carry momentum. For a diffuse wave, we speak of momentum *density*. This is related to energy density by$$\frac{\text{energy}}{\text{volume}}=\frac{\text{momentum}}{\text{volume}}\times c$$
3. It then seems reasonable that the momentum of a photon might be given by:$$p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{hf}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}$$Where $h$ is [[Blackbody Radiation and Planck#^2fe7cc|Planck's constant]]

In the particle view of electromagnetism, the interaction between X-rays and electrons is simply a collection of two particle collisions, with which we can easily apply the conservation of [[Newtonian Dynamics#^5b1640|momentum]] and energy laws. ^3aeda8

> - [[Newtonian Dynamics#^5b1640|Momentum]]:$$\begin{align*}
\text{x-component:}\space \frac{h}{\lambda}&=\frac{h}{\lambda'}\text{cos}(\theta)+\gamma_um_eu\text{cos}(\phi)\\
\text{y-component:}\space\space 0\space&=\frac{h}{\lambda'}\text{sin}(\theta)+\gamma_um_eu\text{sin}(\phi)
\end{align*}$$
>- Energy:$$h\frac{c}{\lambda}+m_ec^2=h\frac{c}{\lambda'}+\gamma_um_ec^2$$

>Note that for the electron, relativisitic equations must be used. For the photon this is unecessary because it travels at the speed of light, and all tests confirm this.
>The momentum of a photon is:$$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$$
>Through lengthy algebra, we can eliminate the electron speed $u$ and scattering angle $\phi$, giving us:$$\lambda-\lambda'=\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\text{cos}(\theta))$$So the difference in wavelengths depends only on the angle that the photon scatters away with, and nothing else.

**The Correspondence Principle**
The question still remains, is electromagnetic radiation a wave or a collection of photons?
- The particle analysis seems to work well when analyzing x-rays and other short wavelengths, but if the wavelength is sufficiently long, classical wave theory proves useful as well.
**Correspondence Principle**: A new nonclassical law should agree with the classical laws to a certain limit, or error.
- This is more of a guideline than anything
- An example is that a long wavelength of visible light striking an electron will produce results within 5% of the classical wave theory when calculated using the new particle theory


**Note: Inelastic Collisions**
- The collision above with the electron and photon is perfectly elastic
- The photon is purely kinetic energy (with no mass), so kinetic energy is conserved in the collision
- The mass and therefore internal energy of the electron cannot change
