# The Free Particle Shroedinger Equation
Recall the transverse mechanical wave function, and recall Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves.

The equation for [[Properties of Matter Waves#^4eeaaa|matter waves]] is called the **Schroedinger Equation**

>[!example] The Shroedinger Equation for Free particles (one dimension)
>In one dimension, and with no external forces, the matter wave is governed by$$-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{\partial^{2}\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}=i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial t}$$ 
>Notice tht $i=\sqrt{-1}$ is present in the equation, bringing in imaginary numbers
>- This is here for one simple reason
>- Matter waves could be governed by two equations, like Maxwell's
>- A complex function naturally has two parts, and therefore has twice the information, so only one equation is necessary

>[!example] The Probability Density Function
>Recall that the [[Double Slit Experiment#^1ac403|probability density]] is proportional to the square of the amplitude
>So, the equation comes to be$$\text{probability density }=|\Psi(x,t)|^{2}=\Psi^{*}(x,t)\Psi(x,t)=[\text{Re }\Psi(x,t)]^{2}+[\text{Im }\Psi(x,t)]^{2}$$

>[!example] The Plane Wave
>This is the most basic solution of the Schroedinger Equation
>$$\Psi(x,t)=Ae^{i(kx-\omega t)}$$
>This is related to a classical interpretation of energy, as using this to derive an energy equation yields $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
>Also note:$$|\Psi(x,t)|=A$$
