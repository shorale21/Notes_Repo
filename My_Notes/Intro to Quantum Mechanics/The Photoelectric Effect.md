# The Photoelectric Effect
>[!example] The Photoelectric Effect
>- The effect where a light beam directed at a surface can disturb and even liberate electrons
>- Light causes the flow of electricity
>- The minimum energy required the remove the electron, the work function $\phi$, is specific to the material

Up until now, the prevailing theory was that light moved as a wave. However, the photoelectric effect seemed to contradict this.

Einstein proposed that light is actually made up of particles called **photons**
>[!example] Photons
>A **photon** is a quantum particle that makes up light, and is the cause of the photoelectric effect. Photons have an energy of$$E=hf$$
>Where $h$ is [[Blackbody Radiation and Planck#^2fe7cc|Planck's constant]].

>[!info] How the Photoelectric Effect works
>- A photon is fired towards a surface containing an electron
>- The photon has energy $hf$
>- If the energy is less than the work function, $hf<\phi$, then the electron is not ejected
>- If the energy is greater than the work funciton, the electron is ejected and the photon transfers all of its energy to the electron
>- Since the photon had greater energy than the work function, some of this energy will be transferred to kinetic energy in the electron$$KE_{max}=hf-\phi$$
>- In other words, energy in light is **quantized**
