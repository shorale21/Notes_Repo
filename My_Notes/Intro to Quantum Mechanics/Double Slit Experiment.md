# The Double Slit Experiment
>[!example] The Experiment
>Imagine a beam of [[The Standard Model#^80ae64|electrons]] striking a barrier with a slit cut into it
>Beyond is a screen which registers each electron that hits it, displaying color wherever an electron arrives
>- **Case 1: Wide Slit**
>	- Imagine the slit is wide and comparable to the beam, then the beam would pass through
>	- the beam would create a stripe on the screen roughly the width of the slit
>- **Case 2: Single Thin Slit**
>	- If the slit was much thinner than the beam, we would observe the electron spread to cover the entire screen
>	- the electrons do not seem to be behaving as particles
>- **Case 3: Double Slit**
>	- If we add a second slit, then we suddenly get an intereference pattern on the screen
>	- This conclusively shows wave behavior
>
>Say we want to predict where an electron will be detected next, based on what we observe on the screen already.
>
>The probabillity that an electron arrives in a certain area would theoretically be **proportional** to the density of electron spots in that area.
>
>This hints that the probability would be proportional to the **intensity** at a spot, which is in turn proportional to the square of the **amplitude** of the wave. In fact,$$\big(\text{Probability to detect a }\textit{particle}\big)\propto\big(\text{Amplitude of }\textit{wave}\big)^2$$
>It's interesting to contemplate the meaning of this
>- We would ask, "what is oscillating?"
>- One answer is that *probability* is oscillating

>[!important] The Bragg Law
>When shooting beams of light or electrons through crystals, in the atomic planes in the crytal are sufficiently close together, wave interference occurs
>Specifically, Constructive intereference occurs at angles where$$2d\sin(\theta)=m\lambda$$
>We can use this law to determine $d$, the distance between atomic planes in crystals
