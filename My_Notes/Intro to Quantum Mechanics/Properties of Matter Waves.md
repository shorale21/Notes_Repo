# Properties of Matter Waves
We want an equation describing wave behaviour, specifically amplitude.

For example, in mechanical waves we have a $D(x,t)$ and in electromagnetic waves we have $E(x,t)$ and $B(x,t)$.

For matter waves, we use $\Psi(x,t)$. This should be referred to as the **Probability Amplitude** ^4eeaaa

>[!example] Wavelength of Matter
>De Broglie hypothesised (and was later confirmed) that the wavelength of matter depends on its momentum, given by$$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}$$
>Note that $h$ is [[Blackbody Radiation and Planck#^2fe7cc|Planck's Constant]]
>This is often referred to as the **De Broglie Wavelength**
>This might be more useful expressed as the wave number,$$k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$$
>We can use the definition:$$\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}$$To express this as$$k=\frac{p}{\hbar}$$

>[!example] Frequency of Matter
>It is the same as electromagnetic radiation, so$$f=\frac{E}{h}$$
>It might be more convienient to express this in terms of angular frequency, $\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$
>So we have$$\omega=\frac{E}{\hbar}$$

>[!example] Velocity
>Wave velocity is not super useful, but it can be correctly determined through $v=\lambda f$
>And so$$v_{wave}=f\lambda=\frac{E}{h}\frac{h}{p}=\frac{E}{p}$$
>However, this may or may not be the speed of the particle
>Massless particles, such as photons have the relation $E=pc$, and so we can see that this is correct, giving $c=\frac{E}{p}$ which is the speed of the wave
>However, particles of matter do not move at $c$, so this is inaccurate
