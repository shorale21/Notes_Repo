# Contrapositive Proof
Recall the [[Logical Operators#^b00fb9|contrapositive law]] for conditional statements

Sometimes, it is easier to prove the contrapositive of a statement.

Remember that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the statement, and that means proving the contrapositive is the same as proving the actual statement.

>[!example] Direct Proof of a Proposition
>Consider the proposition: If $P$, then $Q$
>To prove it, do the following:
>$$\begin{align*}
&\textbf{Proposition}\text{: If }P\text{ then }Q\\
&Proof. \text{ suppose } \sim Q.\\
&\quad\text{.}\\
&\quad\text{.}\\
&\quad\text{.}\\
&\text{Therefore } \sim P.
\end{align*}$$
