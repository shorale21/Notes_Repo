# Consequences of Einstein's Postulates
- [[Intro to Special Relativity#^5e1b14|Einstein's postulate]] that the speed of light moves the same for all observers had multiple consequences on how we view time and space
- Time and space became intertwined and became similarly constructed
- Time was no longer absolute, but relative

>[!tip]+ Consequence 1: Relative Simultenaity
>- Consider the following example
>	- <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> is moving east at a speed $v$, holding a lightbulb in each hand
>	- <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> causes the lightbulbs to flash at precisely the same instant
>	- Since the bulbs are equal distance from their head, and they view the speed of light as $c$ relative to themselves, <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> views the flashes at the same instant of time
>		- In essence, the light beams arrive at their eyes at the same time
>	- Now imagine <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> is standing outside of the frame of reference, watching <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> move east relative to themselves
>	- <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> must also view the speed of light from each bulb to be $c$
>	- Since <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> is moving to the east, the light from one of the bulbs must have farther to go to reach <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> than the other
>	- <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> will view the flashes at different times
>- **Two [[Intro to Special Relativity#^4bf42c|events]] at *different* locations that occur at the *same* time in one frame of reference will not occur at the same time in another frame of reference that is moving relative to the first**

>[!tip]+ Consequence 2: Time Dilation
>- Consider the following example
>	-  <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> is standing on a flatcar moving east and holding a flashlight. There is a mirror at their feet
>	- <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> now shines the flashlight directly downwards to the mirror, where the light bounces straight up back to the flashlight at a speed of $c$
>	- In <font style="color:lime">Observer 1's </font> frame of reference, the light made a path straight down and then straight up
>	- <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> is "at rest" with <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> moving relative to them
>	- When <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> shines the flashlight, <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> sees the light make a diagonal path to the mirror and then a diagonal path upwards, all at a speed $c$
>	- This means the light actually traveled farther in <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2's</font> frame of reference
>	- If light was traveling the same speed, $c$, in both reference frames, <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> actually saw it take a *longer* time for the light to return to the flashlight
>	- This is **Time Dilation**
>- **Two [[Intro to Special Relativity#^4bf42c|events]] occuring at the *same* location in one frame will be separated by a *longer* period of time in a frame moving relative to the first**

>>Where $\Delta t_0$ is the **proper time** which is the change in time from the reference frame where the events occur at the same location

>[!tip]+ Consequence 3: Length Contraction
>- Consider the following example
>	- We have <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> and <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> in their usual frames of reference
>	- <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> now holds a wooden plank and is attempting to measure its length
>		- The best method is to measure the time between two events that occur on each side of the plank
>		- namely, the times that <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> passes each side of the plank
>		- The length would be $\Delta t$ multiplied by the velocity of <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> relative to <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font>
>	- These two events occur at the same location in <font style="color:lime">Observer 1's</font> frame of reference
>	- **Time Dilation** tellls us that this means the time interval we are measuring will in fact be less for <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> than <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font>
>	- Since <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> and <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> measure the same velocity for each other, the length that <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> calculates will be shorter than that calculated by <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font>
>	- This is **Length Contraction**
>- **The length of an object in a frame where it is moving is less than the length of the object in a frame where it is at rest**
>>[!info]- Lorentz Transformation
>>$$L=\frac{L_0}{\gamma_v}$$
>>Where $L_0$ is the **proper length** the length of the object measured from the frame in which the object is at rest
