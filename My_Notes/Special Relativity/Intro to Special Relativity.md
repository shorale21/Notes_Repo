# Basic Concepts of Special Relativity
>[!example] Defintion: Inertial Frames
>A frame of reference in which an object experiencing zero net force moves at constant velocity.
>- Essentially, a reference frame which is not accelerating.
>- Any reference frame moving at 0 or constant velocity is an inertial frame of reference
>- Example: Consider an object floating in free space
>	- There is no net force on said object
>	- If an astronaut were to go by at a constant speed, it would see the object moving at constant speed
>	- the astronaut's point of view is an inertial frame

>[!example] Einsteins Postulates of Special Relativity
>1. The form of each physical law is the same in all inertial frames
>	- Any mechanicistic property will be viewed the same in all inertial frames of reference
>	- **Example:** consider a man dropping a ball
>		- If he was standing on the ground, at rest, the ball would make a straight path to the ground
>		- If he was standing on a train moving at constant velocity, the ball would also make a straight path to the ground
>	- It is impossible to prove whether your frame is moving at a constant velocity, or is at rest
>1. The speed of light is the same in all frames
>	- The speed of light, $c$, is equal to $\space\sim3\times10^8$m/s
>	- The speed of a light ray will be viewed as equal to all observers
>	-  **Example**: Consider an observer, <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font>, watching another observer, <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font>
>		- <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> is moving perpendicular to <font style="color:lime">Observer 1's</font> line of sight, and <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> is at rest
>		- If <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> were to activate a laser pointer in the direction they were moving, Newtonian Mechanics would dictate that the speed of the light as viewed by <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> would be greater than $c$.
>		- This is not the case. Both Observers would view the laser beam as moving with the speed $c$
