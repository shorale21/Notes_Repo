# Momentum and Energy
Classically, momentum is described as $mu$ where $m$ is the mass and $u$ is the velocity. The total momentum of a system can be determined with the sum $\sum_{i}m_iu_i$, and is [[Newtonian Dynamics#^5b1640|conserved]]

An interesting observation shows that $\sum_{i}m_iu_i$ is not conserved in *any* frame at speeds near the speed of light, violating one of the most fundamental laws of motion

Let's apply the [[Velocity Transformation#^58af0b|relatavistic velocity transformation]] to our relatavistic momentum.$$P_{total}'=\gamma_vP_{total}-v\gamma_v\sum_{i}\gamma_{u_i}m_i$$
If $P$ and $P'$ are constant/conserved, $\sum_{i}\gamma_{u_i}m_i$ must also be conserved. So the question is, what is this quantity? Or what is it related to? The answer is total energy, leading us to the equation$$E=\gamma_vmc^2$$
Since when a mass is stationary, $\gamma_v=1$, we can get an equation for internal energy:$$E_{internal}=mc^2$$

To find kinetic energy, we simply use the equation: KE = energy while moving - energy while at rest$$KE=E-E_{internal}=\gamma_vmc^2-mc^2=(\gamma_v-1)mc^2$$

This is a very interesting note, that the internal energy of an object depends solely on its mass, and vice versa.
If you add energy to an object, such as heating it up, the mass increases. This seemingly extreme phenomenon is balanced out by the fact that $c^2$ is a very large number. An increase in 1 kg of mass would require an addition of around $9\times10^{16}$ J of energy.
