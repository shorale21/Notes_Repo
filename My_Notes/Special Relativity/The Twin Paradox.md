# The Twin Paradox
A very prominent paradox in special relativity, that if one of two twins stays on Earth and the other moves away at a very high speed, they would see each other aging slower. Then when the second twin returns, each twin would claim that the other is younger. Impossible!

The key point to understand here is that in order for the second twin to return to earth, they must accelerate to change directions. If an observer accelerates, or their frame of reference is [[Intro to Special Relativity#^054abc|non-inertial]]. When the second twin accelerates, they move into a different frame of reference in which the first twin has a different viewed age, therefore resolving the paradox.
>[!example] Explaining the Twin Paradox
>To explain the twin paradox, let us reintroduce our two observers, <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> and <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font>.
>- Say that while <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> stays on Earth, <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> moves at constant speed (near the speed of light) away towards a point, $X$
>- <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> sees <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> moving away at near the speed of light, and due to [[Consequences of SR#^9271df|time dilation]] (<font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> is moving relative to <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font>), sees <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> aging slowly
>- The opposite is true from <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2's</font> point of view
>- We can now introduce a third observer, <font style="color:yellow">Observer 3</font>
>- <font style="color:yellow">Observer 3</font> is moving towards Earth from the other side of $X$
>- <font style="color:yellow">Observer 3</font> sees <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> as much older since they started very far away
>- So, when <font style="color:yellow">Observer 3</font> passes $X$, <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> is much older in this frame of reference than in the frame of reference experienced by <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font>
>- When <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> *accelerates*, to change direction at the point $X$, <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> switches into the reference frame viewed by <font style="color:yellow">Observer 3</font>
>- <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> will now see <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> as much older
>- As <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> returns, special relativity holds true for the [[Intro to Special Relativity#^054abc|inertial frames]]
>- And finally, when <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> reaches Earth, they will claim that <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font> is older
>- Similarly, <font style="color:lime">Observer 1</font>, who has been in an inertial frame this entire time, and seen <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> aging slower this entire time, will claim that <font style="color:cyan">Observer 2</font> is younger, consistent with the other reference frame
>- The paradox is resolved
