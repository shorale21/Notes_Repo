# Sets
- A **set** is a collection of items.
- These items are called **elements**
- Sets are ofted denoted with curly braces, such as $\{1, 2, 3\}$
- Sets can have infinite or finite elements, ex: $\{\dots,1,2,3,\dots\}$
- Two sets are considered **equal** if they have exactly the same elements
		- ex: $\{1,2,3\}=\{1,2,3\}$
- To express an element inside a set, we use "$\in$"
		- ex: $2\in\{1,2,3\}$
- Fundamental sets:
		- Natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$
		- Integer numbers, $\mathbb{Z}=\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$
		- Rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{a}{b}|a\in\mathbb{Z},b\in\mathbb{Z}\}$
		- Real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$
- The **Cardinality** of a set describes the size, and is the number of elements. Denoted by $|A|$
		- ex: If $A=\{1,2,3\}$ then $|A|=3$
- The **empty set** is the set $\{\}$ and is usually denoted by $\varnothing$ or $\emptyset$
- **Set builder notation** consists of $X=\{expression:rule\}$ with $:$ or $|$ meaning "such that"
