# Subsets and Power Sets
>[!info] Definition of a subset
>- If every element of a [[Sets#^cfbc64|set]] $A$ is also an element of a set $B$, the we say that $A$ is a **subset** of $B$.
>		- This is denoted with the symbol "$\subseteq$"
>		- In this example we would say "$A\subseteq B$"

- Note, the [[Sets#^a39cdf|empty set]] is a subset of every set, including itself
- For the [[Sets#^d3aac2|fundamental sets]], $\mathbb{N}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}\subseteq\mathbb{Q}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$
- If a finite set has $n$ elements, then it has $2^n$ subsets

>[!info] Definition of a Power Set
>If $A$ is a [[Sets#^cfbc64|set]], then the **power set** of $A$ is another set, denoted by $\mathcal{P}(A)$, and defined to be the set of all subsets of $A$. $$\mathcal{P}(A) = \{X:X\subseteq A\}$$
- If $A$ is a finite set, then $|\mathcal{P}(A)|=2^{|A|}$ (using the [[Sets#^f7ff23|cardinality]])
