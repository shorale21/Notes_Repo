In set theory we like to define a **universe** for a set to exist in. This helps define what types of elements are in the set.
- For example, we can say the set ${1, 2, 3}$ is part of the universal set $\mathbb{N}$
- If a set $A$ is in a univers $U$, then $A\subseteq B$

>[!info] Definition: Complement
>The **complement** of a set $A$ with a universal set $U$ is $$\bar{A}=U-A$$
