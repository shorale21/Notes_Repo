>[!example] Defintion: Vector Field
>Let $D$ be a region in $\mathbb{R}^n$. A **Vector Field** on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a function $\vec{\textbf{F}}$ that assigns each point $(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})$ a $n$-dimensional vector. These functions are often written in the forms:
>$$\vec{\textbf{F}}=\big\langle R_{1}(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}),\dots,R_{n}(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\big\rangle$$
>Where the functions $R_i$ are scalar functions, or scalar fields.

>[!example] Definition: The Gradient
>If $f(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})$ is a scalar function in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the **gradient** of $f$, denoted as $\nabla f$, is defined by
>$$\nabla f=\Bigg\langle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}},\dots,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}\Bigg\rangle$$
>Thus $\nabla f$ is a [[Vector Fields#^b337c0|vector field]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ called the gradient vector field.

>[!example] Definition: Conservative Vector Field
>A [[Vector Fields#^b337c0|vector field]] $\vec{\textbf{F}}$ is called conservative if it is the [[Vector Fields#^062dc4|gradient]] of some scalar function $f$.

>In this situation, $f$ is called a **potential function**
