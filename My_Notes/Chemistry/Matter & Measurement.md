## Atomic Theory

>[!example] Defintion: Atom
>The submicroscopic particles that serve as the building blocks of ordinary matter. Atoms bind together in geometric patterns to form matter as we know it.
>
> Atoms are mostly made up of protons and neutrons, which in turn are made up of [[The Standard Model#^592e8e|quarks]].
> Atoms also contain [[The Standard Model#^80ae64|electrons]]

>[!example] Definition: Molecule
>A Molecule is a geometrical arrangement of bound atoms, that are bonded together. Molecules form the basis for most substances in matter.

Ordinary matter consists of three different states: Solid, liquid, gas. ^9486db
>[!example] Definition: Solid
>The solid state of matter is the state where atoms or molecules are packed tightly together in a fixed structure. These particles will vibrate but not move around or past each other.
>A solid therefore has a rigid shape.
>
>A crystalline solid is a solid in which the particles form a repeating pattern
>- Ex: Salt, Diamonds
>
>An amorphous solid has no pattern or order to the structure.
>- Ex: Plastic, Glass
>
>A defining characteristic is that solids have fixed shape and fixed volume.
>
>**Transitions**
>- To liquid: *melting*
>- To Gas: *sublimation*

>[!example] Definition: Liquid
>In the liquid state, atoms/molecules pack similarly to solids, but without structure. This means that while the atoms are packed tightly, they are free to move relative to each other in any way.
>
>This means it does not have a fixed shape. Liquids will assume the shape of any solid container they are in
>
>In this way, liquids have fixed volume but not fixed shape
>
>**Transitions**
>- To Solid: *freezing*
>- To Gas: *boiling* or *evaporation*

>[!example] Definition: Gas
>In the gaseous state of matter, atoms/molecules have much space between them, and have complete freedom of motion
>
>Gases assume the shape and volume of the container they are in
>
>In this way, gases do not have fixed volume or fixed shape
>
>**Transitions**
>- To Solid: *deposition*
>- To Liquid: *condensation*

Here are some preliminary classifications:
- A **Pure Substance** is made up of only one component
	- That component can be either classified as an **element** or a **compound**
	- This is based on whether the component can be broken into smaller pieces
- A **Mixture** is made up of multiple components
	- Classified as **Heterogenous**: the mixture composition varies from one refion to another
	- Classified as **Homogenous**: the mixture composition is uniform throughout

## Separating Mixtures
One way to separate is called **decanting**, carefully manually separating components, such as pouring water out of sand into a different container

>[!example] Definition: Distillation
>A method of separating a mixture of substances with different boiling temperatures.
>
>The substance with the lowest boiling point will become gas first and can be transferred to a different container via a condenser

>[!example] Definition: Filtration
>If a mixture is composed of an insoluble solid and a liquid, we can use a device called a filter to separate the solid and the liquid.
