# Special Laplace Transforms Part 2
<u>**The Unit Step Function**</u>
When examining equations of the form $y''+by'+cy=F(t)$, it often arises that the forcing function $F(t)$ is either [[Laplace Transforms#^10c23f|piecewise continuous]] or discontinuous.

The **Unit Step Function** $u_a(t)$ is defined by $$u_a(t)=\begin{cases}0,\quad 0\le t<a\\1,\quad t \ge a \\ \end{cases}$$
where $a$ is any positive number ^08bff2
