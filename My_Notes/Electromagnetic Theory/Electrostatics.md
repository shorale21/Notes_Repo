## Experimental Laws
>[!example] Coulombs Law
>The law for action at a distance between two charged particles is experimentally established:
>$$F=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\frac{qq'}{r^2}$$
>The constant $\epsilon_0$ is dependent on the system of units

This type of force can be expressed as a function of a potential:
$$V'=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\frac{q'}{r}$$
Where the force is then
$$\textbf{F}=-q\nabla V'$$
>[!example] Electric Potential
>We can define the electric potential at any point in the medium to be
>$$V=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\sum\limits_{1}^{n}\frac{q_i}{r_i}$$

Then we can define a field based of of this as 
$$\textbf{E}=-\nabla V$$
Then the force is defined as
$$\textbf{F}=q\textbf{E}$$
