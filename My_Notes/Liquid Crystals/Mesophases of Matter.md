## Solid vs. Liquid
For a given material, the phase is generally associated with the degree of order of arrangement of molecules making up that material.
Solids have a high degree of order, and therefore show a 3-dimensional regularity of structure.
Liquids, on the other hand, have no 3-dimensional periodicity, which is what defines that phase.

Mesophases then occur by showing less order than a solid, but more order than liquid.
>[!example] The Smectic Phase
>The Smectic Phase is established by imposing positional order in one, rather than three dimensions. 
>This mesophase appears as a system of 2-dimensional layers stacked on top of each other, separated by some sort of spacing.
>Essentially as layers of liquids stacked on top of each other, showing one-dimensional periodocity in the up/down direction

>Example: Wood is easier to split along the grain than against it, so the strength of wood is anisotropic

If a system is comprised of anisotropic molecules, mesophases of crystalline solids can occur by either losing orientational order in the distribution while maintaining translational order, or vice versa.
>[!example] Plastic Crystals
>Crystals in which the molecules are in several equivalent orientations, meaning positional order is kept and orientational order is sacrificed.

>Ex: Solid hydrogen, ammonium halides

>[!example] The Nematic Phase
>(This is most liquid crystals). This is a phase in which molecules are preferentially aligned in one direction. This is a mesophase. 
>Thus the crystals are orientationally ordered and not positionally ordered.
