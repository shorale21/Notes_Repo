The main common feature between all liquid crystals is a highly anisotropic shape. An extended structurally rigid anisotropic shape of the base components is the root of nearly all liquid crystal systems.

## Mechanisms of Transition
>[!example] Thermotropic
>Phase transitions are driven by temperature.
>
>These materials are usually organic substances, and exhibit less order as temperature increases, and change phases at specific temperatures.

>[!example] Lyotropic
> Phase transitions are driven by the concentration

## Shape
Another useful way to categorize [[Mesophases of Matter#^cd1979|liquid crystals]] is by the general shape of molecules.

>[!example] Discotic
>The molecules are flat, disc-like molecules made of adjacent benzene rings
>
>Example: Triphenylene

>[!example] Calamitic
>The molecules are rod-like in shape

>[!example] bowlic
>The molecules are bowl-shaped

>[!example] bent-core
>The molecutes are bent shaped.
>
>The cross-over shape of the bent-core crystals are called "banana liquid crystals" 

>[!example] Common Liquid Crystal Designs
>The majority of liquid crystalline systems aare those with components from a class of small organic molecules.
>The molecule looks as follows:
>- The core is composed of two benzene rings linked together directly or by an intermediate group
>	- This core gives the molecule its anisotropic structure
>- flexible end-chains, usually alkyl groups, are linked directly to the benzene rings, or by an intermediate oxygen or ester
>
>The phase transitions are thermotropic
>The flexibility of the chains can be ignored usually, thus allowing the molecule to be treated as a rod

Most rod-like structures in a suitable solvent will likewise form the various phases associated with liquid crystals.
