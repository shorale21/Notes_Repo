# Basic Logical Operators
We use logical operators to symbolically notate [[Statements#^1794d4|statements]]

A **Truth Table** is a table describing all possible outcomes of a logical operator

>[!example]- And, Or, and Not
>- The **And** operator connects two statements that must both be true. 
>- We use the $\land$ operator to denote "And"
>- [[Truth_Table_Storage#^4192cd|Truth Table for **And**]]
>$\space$
>- The **Or** operator connects two statements where one of them must be true
>- We use the $\lor$ operator to denote "Or"
>- [[Truth_Table_Storage#^5df80f|Truth Table for **Or**]]
>$\space$
>- The **Not** operator simply reverses a statement
>- We use the $\sim$ operator to denote "not"
>- [[Truth_Table_Storage#^4c16ea|Truth Table for **Not**]]

>[!example] The Conditional Operator
>- For statements of the form "If $P$, then $Q$"
>- We use the notation $P\implies Q$ to denote the above statement
>- [[Truth_Table_Storage#^cd45c2|Truth Table for the conditional operator]]
